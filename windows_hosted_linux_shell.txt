1) Find your ip on a windows computer using the command "ipconfig" in the terminal.
	Your ip will be stored next to the statement "IPv4 address for eth0: "

2) in the windows terminal run: 
	netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=2222 connectaddress="your ip" connectport=2222
	
	netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open Port 2222 for WSL2" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=2222

The first command should respond with nothing while the second command should respond with "Ok."


3) Now swap to your linux shell.
	Run:	sudo service ssh start
	if there is an error run: "ssh-keygen -A" and then run the previus code again.

4) Everything should now be setup and the connections should be open.
	To verify this, in the windows terminal, run: "netsh interface portproxy show v4tov4"
	There should be a Listening Address of 0.0.0.0 with a port of 2222 and a connectable Address with your ip at the same port.

5) You can now connect using Putty or another form of ssh connection service.
	If there is another error, go back to the linux shell and
	Run:	sudo vim /etc/ssh/ssh_config
	and add
		Port 2222
		ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
		PasswordAuthentication yes
	to the file.
	If the error persists connect to sshd_config with the same filepath and make sure PasswordAuthentication is set to yes there as well.
	
Run:	sudo service ssh restart
	between each attempt.

6) Lastly, to end the connection,
	Run: 	netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=2222
in your windows terminal.
